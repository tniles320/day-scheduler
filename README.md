# Work Day Scheduler

This application allows a user to create a daily schedule.<br>
Tasks to be completed can be listed for every hour of the work day.<br>
If the hour is upcoming, the row will be in blue.<br> if the hour is the same as the current time's hour, it will be in green.<br> for everything in the past, it will be in gray.<br>
Once a task is completed the check button on the right will put a red line through that hour's task,<br> and once the page is reloaded that hour will be cleared.
